Communicating over USB using the novacom protocol

The novacom protocol was developed internally at Palm to communicate
a number of different features over USB to their pre device.  Some
of the features of the novacom protocol include:

  - Interactive TTY support for terminal-over-USB
  - File transfer (both send and get)
  - Execute command
  - Read and write memory locations

The novacom device is defined as having:

    USB Class           255 (Vendor Specific)
    USB Subclass        71
    USB Protocol        17

This device defines 3 endpoints, two bulk endpoints (one in, one out)
and an interrupt endpoint.  I am not sure what the interrupt endpoint
is for, but the main communication occurs over the bulk endpoints.

The novacom protocol consists of two different layers:

  - usbl
  - pmux

usbl handles the main communication across the wire.  It is a simple
protocol which identifies two endpoint addresses (host and device),
has some magic numbers, a version number (?) and a command.

The commands, as I have interpreted them, are as follows:

    -------------------------------------------------------------
    USBL Command        Description
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    ANNOUNCEMENT        Establishing the connection
    PMUX                Sending a command to the PMUX layer
    NOP                 Idling on the wire, avoiding a timeout
    
Initially, when establishing the novacom connection, a packet is read
from the incoming bulk endpoint with the following attributes:
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    Field               Description
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    id_tx               A random number associated with the device
    id_rx               All zeros
    command             ANNOUNCEMENT
    
The actual payload associated with the ANNOUNCEMENT packet is as follows:

    --------------------------------------------------------------
    Field               Description
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    serial              ASCII representation of the serial number
    forty               The value 0x40
    zero                The value 0x00
    y                   ???
    z                   ???

Ah ha!  0x4000 is 16384 which corresponds to the MTU size for a castle-linux
connection.  4096 (or 0x1000) is the MTU size for when there is a castle-bootie
connection.  The y and z fields are actually heartbeat values and timeout
values in milliseconds.  For castle-linux, these correspond to 1 second
heartbeats with a 10 second timeout, while for castle-bootie they correspond
to 250ms heartbeats with a 1 second timeout.

To recap:

    -----------------------------------------------------
                                  Connection
    Field               castle-linux        castle-bootie
    -----------------------------------------------------
    MTU                 16384 (0x4000)      4096 (0x1000)
    Heartbeat           1000                250
    Timeout             10000               1000

When replying to a usbl packet, the device will now be in the id_rx field,
and the host ID will be in the id_tx field for the packet.  Since this is
a strict point-to-point connection at the lowest level, I think these
shouldn't change over the lifetime of the connection.

More investigation is required in the castle-bootie protocol and how this
mode essentially works.

NOTE: The MTU, heartbeat and timeout were all derived from messages spewing
from port 6970 of localhost while connecting the phone to a macbook pro
running novacomd.

Once replied to successfully, the usbl command field will transition from
being an ANNOUNCEMENT to a NOP as long as there is no data being pushed
up from the device.

A NOP payload is very similar to the ANNOUNCEMENT payload with the 
exception that only the null terminated ASCII serial number is present.

Sitting idly, novacom will receive a new NOP packet every 0.5 to 1 second.
There is a timeout associated such that if no NOP packet is received, the
connection is lost and must be reestablished.

The PMUX command is used to talk with the next layer up, the pmux layer.
This layer provides simple packet counting and acknowledgement to guarantee
packet delivery.

A usbl pmux command payload has a structure as such:

    --------------------------------------------------------------
    Field                   Description
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    magic                   "pmux" in ascii
    mode                    3 = open (Not sure what others may be?)
    directon                0x62 = in, 0x37 = out
    ack_synx                0 = syn, 1 = ack
    status                  0x0001 = not connected, 0x1000 = established ... 0x0001 = control, 0x1000 = data?
    sequence_num            Number independent sequence for in and out
    length_payload          Total payload length
    length_pmux_packet      Payload length + pmux header length (28)
    zero                    Zero
    payload                 The pmux payload data
    
I haven't had the ability to test any novacom communications protocols other
than just the tty just yet.
